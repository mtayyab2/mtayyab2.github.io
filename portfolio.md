### These are my projects that I have worked on individually as well as in a team:

## Chat with your PDFs Locally on Your PC [LINK](https://github.com/mtayyab2/Chat_with_PDF)

Tired of reading your whole documents with loads of irrelevant information that you don't need? Or you want to scrape a book for one single thing, but don't want to read the whole book? or You are looking for an understanding of a concept in a different language that you don't speak or understand. Don't Worry! this project has you covered with an additional layer of privacy to run it locally on your pc without the need for internet or a **"PAID API"**. It has the same interface like ChatGPT or other chatbots. You can ask your personal assistant to do analysis of a data you are working on, or make you understand a concept that will take too long to understand via the conventional method. The better your prompts are, the better this assistant will work for you.

## Local Chatbot: Your Personal Assistant [LINK](https://github.com/mtayyab2/Local_ChatBot)

Are you Skeptical about your data being leaked to online chatbots and AI assistants. Well you can build your own Personal Assistant for free (although you would need atleast a 4gb GPU on your PC and about 16 gigs of RAM). You won't need to have an internet connection to use this chatbot, everything runs locally on your computer. Additional functions include, Saving/Archiving Chat, starting a new Chat, and selecting different LLM models you have installed/downloaded on your computer. PS this is a very basic chatbot and the saved chats will be lost once you close your localhost browser, but you can copy paste the text in a text or doc file to save the conversation.

## Predicting Hospital Readmission for Diabetes Patients
