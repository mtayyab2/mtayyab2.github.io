Below, you'll find a selection of my most notable projects, showcasing both individual and collaborative efforts. While some projects may not be publicly available on my GitHub repository (due to freelance or confidential nature), I'm excited to share an overview of my accomplishments with you. You can also download my <a href="/assets/imgs/Tahir-Resume.pdf">Resume</a>.

### Chat with your PDFs Locally on Your PC

For users desiring efficient document processing without sifting through extraneous details, seeking specific insights from lengthy texts like books, or grasping complex concepts in a non-native languageâ€”this project offers a localized solution with enhanced privacy and no reliance on internet connectivity. Mimicking interfaces of popular chatbots like ChatGPT, this personal AI assistant can perform data analysis tasks and elucidate intricate ideas directly from your prompts. Optimal prompt crafting is key to maximizing the effectiveness of this tailored local assistant.

### Local Chatbot: Your Personal Assistant

I've developed an open-source personal AI assistant that operates locally on your PC with minimal internet reliance, providing privacy for those concerned about data leaks from online services. This local chatbot requires at least a 4GB GPU and 16 GB RAM but offers functionalities like saving/archiving chats offline, initiating new conversations without an internet connection, and utilizing locally stored LLM models. Though it's in the early stages with basic features and saved chats disappear after closing the browser, users can export their discussions to documents for safekeeping.

### Detecting Tribal Villages in Satellite Images

In my freelance role, I did an AI-driven project to detect remote African tribal villages from satellite images sourced via Google Maps API. Utilizing Ultralytics' YOLOv8 for machine learning and image processing techniques. We developed a system that accurately maps village locations with global coordinates. This facilitates NGOs in targeting aid delivery effectively.

### Predicting Hospital Readmission for Diabetes Patients

I led an impactful project to develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Artificial Neural Networks. The initiative focused on forecasting hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients in the US by analyzing data from 130 hospitranals spanning a nine-year period (1999-2008). Our models accurately classified the likelihood of one-month post-discharge readmissions, considering variables like medical history, medications, and demographic factors.

### Advanced Camera Calibration Techniques Utilizing Stereo Images from GTA V

A project focused on camera calibration within Grand Theft Auto V's virtual environment, I utilized ScriptHook mod engine's epipolar geometry to autonomously derive precise camera poses. This work eliminated reliance on external knowledge of the game world and holds significant implications for 3D space applications in gaming, entertainment, and immersive technologies.
